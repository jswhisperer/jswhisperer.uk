I mentioned Proton Native [earlier](https://jswhisperer.uk/post/web-view-apps-on-your-os/) but hadnâ€™t tried it extensively until now.

So what is it, here are some of the promises

Same syntax & components as React Native

Works with existing React libraries such as Redux

Cross platform

No more Electron

Compatible with all normal Node.js packages

Hot reloading

So PN had a very interesting beginning, it utilized a library called `libui-node` which was kinda neat. In my opinion it wasnâ€™t ready for production; it didnâ€™t even have the ability to include images. I believe Vuido still uses libui-node. Since then the author totally rewrote PN with [QT](https://www.qt.io/) bindings. Hereâ€™s a great [post](https://dev.to/kusti8/proton-native-v2-create-cross-platform-desktop-apps-with-react-2fdo) of the changes. Thereâ€™s a lot of cool features now, like flexbox layout and images.

PN utilizes react as the view layer and allows you to write node.js directly in those files. This library feels like a spiritual successor to now defunct React Native Desktop. I wonâ€™t go through the setup thatâ€™s [here](https://proton-native.js.org). Right now there is a lack of components but there is enough to get stuff done, numbering in at 9 right now.

Ok some caveets I found was the documentation is pretty sparse again. It took me a lot of reading the source code and exploring issues to figure out some thing. For example there is an `<Image>` component and the extent of the docs is

`props : style, resizeMode, source`

What it doesnâ€™t tell you is that source takes an uri like so

`source={ uri: "image.png" }` another problem is that right now only external url images seem to work, not local. Lastly reading through the issues apparently only .png works on macOs.

Another couple weird issues `border-radius` is really finicky works on mostly square dimension components but not rectangular. Emojiâ€™s are not rendered ðŸ˜ž .

Ok enough bad mouthing, letâ€™s see some interesting stuff! I am really bored at home right now and lacking work so Iâ€™ve been doing lotâ€™s of fun apps and experiments. I use Ubuntu and nordVPN, I like GUIâ€™s for a lot of things and unfortunately there isnâ€™t one. What I decided to try was mapping the nordVPN cli to Proton Native. This isnâ€™t obviously a production ready approach, for that there is an API. I didnâ€™t want to setup and account and read docs all day so I went with my CLI solution. If you want to see a pretty good example of using the API check out [this](https://github.com/AhmedAli7O1/nordvpn).

Way at the bottom of this [page](https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Linux/1325531132/Installing-and-using-NordVPN-on-Debian-Ubuntu-Elementary-OS-and-Linux-Mint.htm) are the CLI options for nordVPN. on an aside I found out linux is terribly supported even here, thereâ€™s no option to connect via a country or anything very useful at all. Hereâ€™s a few useless commands they offer

```bash
nordvpn countries # - See the country list.

nordvpn cities # - See the city list.

nordvpn groups # - See a list of available server groups.
```

I mean it just prints out some countries, you canâ€™t use that info in any way though.

Ok some of the useful commands are

```bash
nordvpn account # - See account information

nordvpn status # - See the connection status.

nordvpn login # - Log in.

nordvpn connect
```

Another interesting issue, nordvpn connect does accept a server but you have to give a specific one like `ca1111` why donâ€™t they just accept a country hereâ€¦

Inside my project I started to link up these features with node.js

```javascript

const { spawn } = require("child_process");

spawnNord(flag) {
  return spawn("nordvpn", [flag]);
}

nordStatus() {

  const output = this.spawnNord("status");

  output.stdout.on("data", (data) => {

    const str = data.toString("utf8");

    const sanData = str
      .replace(/\r?\n|\r/g, "")
      .replace("-", "")
      .trim();

  this.setState({
    status: sanData,
  });

});

```

So a spawned child process returns the data in a buffer so I convert that to a string, then do some dark arts to clean up the string. and Voila I have a status state.

Connect was very similar

```javascript
  nordConnect(country = "") {
  let server = "";

  if (country) {

  server = serverList.find((x) => x.country === "usa").server;

  }


  const connect = spawn("nordvpn", ["connect", server]);

  connect.stdout.on("data", (data) => {

  var loginStd = data.toString("utf8");

  });

  }
```

I decided I wanted a nifty toggle component so I built it from scratch

```jsx
<View style={ display: "flex" , width: "100%" , height: "80px" , flexDirection: "row" , justifyContent: "space-evenly" ,
    backgroundColor: "#24476f" }>

    <View style={ display: "flex" , backgroundColor: this.state.toggled ? "gray" : "#82bc4e" , borderRadius: 20, height:
        45, width: 75, marginTop: "10px" , borderTop: "1px solid #333333" , alignItems: this.state.toggled
        ? "flex-start" : "flex-end" , justifyContent: "center" , } onPress={this.nordConnect}>

        <TouchableOpacity style={ borderRadius: 20, height: 40, width: 40, marginTop: "-1px" , marginRight: 5,
            marginLeft: 5, backgroundColor: "white" , borderTop: "1px solid transparent" , } onPress={this.toggle}>
        </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
```

What I ended up with looks like this

One more warning about spawn processes, yes itâ€™s super fun, but right now PN doesnâ€™t have a beforeClose event needed to kill those processes.

Ok last step time to [package](https://proton-native.js.org) this bad boy for distribution. Iâ€™ll let you read those for yourself but one thing I tripped on was this command

```bash
npx nexe bin/index.js -o out/my-app # Create our binary
```

If you are not using one of the available matching prebuilt binaries it tries to build locally, and for me it just failed hard; so check [here](https://github.com/nexe/nexe/releases/) and use nvm to adjust your node.js to a matching one.

So my last surprise was the generated app was 170mb. Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s on-par with electron. I tried compiling the example caculator app also just to double check it was some weird dependancy I included. So yes you can get a 170mb calculator if you want.

Stay tuned Iâ€™m going to check out nodeGUI next post.

Questions, comments, critisims, likes, whatever?
