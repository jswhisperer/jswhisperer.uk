Wouldn't it be grand to click a button and have your mobile's native share dialog come up?
This used to take funky third party js widgets, or registering for all the various site api's individual; I remember it could take a week to get it right with SEO back in the golden days.

Well friends fear no more check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share">webshare</a> api

Now hypothetically say you have a fullscreened progressive web app, looks slick don't it? The problem though is the missing url bar.

Example:

Here's your solution in the form of a method. One caveat is this must be called on a user action like click.

```js
share() {
      if (navigator.share) {
        navigator
          .share({
            title: 'title',
            text: 'description',
            url: `url`
          })
          .catch(err => {
            console.log(`Couldn't share because of`, err.message);
          });
      } else {
        console.log("web share not supported");
      }
    }
```

```html
<a class="show-mobile" href="#" @click.prevent="share">ðŸ”— share</a>
```

Oh one more thing, this is only supported on mobile devices. I find this solution better than the user agent sniffing dark arts.

```css
.show-mobile {
	display: none;
}
@media (pointer: coarse) {
	.show-mobile {
		display: inline-block;
	}
}
```

Why not fire up your cellular device and give it a try with this article, how meta would that be?
