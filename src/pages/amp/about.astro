			</h2>
			Ahoy, dear reader. <br />
			<p>
				I started my life in a small town on the cusp of Toronto, Ontario in 1985. Upon completing
				high school I moved into the big city where sights, sounds and tastes influenced me to start
				my adventure in design and development studying Graphic Design. Three years later I headed
				out into the real world working hard and landing exciting jobs with an amazing agency
				starting my career off in mainly a print medium.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being that young, I travelled and found myself in Perth, Australia. Design and a fascination
				for the web never left my side. When I returned home to Canada, a slightly more knowledgable
				chap, I kept up with the latest technologies by reading and learning as much as I could for
				a cathartic web experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				I strive for perfection and have a strong belief in providing the best possible work for my
				clients. I have found myself again on the other side of the world in Cape Town, South Africa
				living with my kitten and lady. I make craft beer and enjoy the mountains and ocean on my
				door step. From design to development, my knowledge and experience is vast with my passion
				lying with coding, design and art. When I grow up, I want to be Don Draper.
